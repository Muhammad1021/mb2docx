Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Clinical Performance Analyst position with your team. My background in family medicine, combined with hands-on EPIC documentation and data verification experience, positions me to support your team's evidence-based reporting.

What I bring is not just data handling experience but an understanding of why clinical data quality issues occur in the first place. During my residency, I documented care for 6 to 16 inpatients daily in EPIC across multiple specialties, generating the exact operational data that feeds performance reports and case costing.

I have strong Excel skills and am comfortable with SQL for report writing. My research background established rigorous documentation habits and systematic quality control procedures. I am eager to apply this combination of clinical insight and analytical discipline to support your organization's operational and strategic goals.

I am available immediately and flexible with hours as the position requires. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe
